<font size=5>The<b> Human Head</b> consists of a fleshy outer portion surrounding the bony skull, within which sits the brain. The head rests on the neck, and is provided bony support for movement by the seven cervical vertebrae. The face is the anterior part of the head, containing the sensory organs the eyes, nose and mouth.</font>
</p><br></li>

<li><p style="color:DodgerBlue;">
<font size=5><B>Eyes</B> are organs of the visual system. They provide organisms with vision, the ability to receive and process visual detail, as well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision. Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons.</font>
</p><br></li>

<li><p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">
<font size=5>A <b>Nose</b> is a protuberance in vertebrates that houses the nostrils, or nares, which receive and expel air for respiration alongside the mouth. Behind the nose are the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses.</font>
</p><br></li>

<li><p style="color:HotPink;">
<font size=5>The <b>Ear</b> is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal.</font>
</p><br></li>

<li><p style="color:Purple;">
<font size=5>In human anatomy, the <b>Mouth</b> is the first portion of the alimentary canal that receives food and produces saliva. The oral mucosa is the mucous membrane epithelium lining the inside of the mouth.</font>
</p><br></li>

<li><p style="color:DarkGoldenRod;">
<font size=5>The blood provides your body with the oxygen and nutrients it needs. It also carries away waste. Your <b>Heart</b> is sort of like a pump, or two pumps in one. The right side of your <b>Heart</b> receives blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs.</font>
</p><br></li>

<li><p style="color:Coral;">
<font size=5>the <b>Arm</b> is the part of the upper limb between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. In common usage, the arm extends to the hand.</font>
</p><br></li>

<li><p style="color:DarkOliveGreen;">
<font size=5>A <b>Hand</b> is the part of the body at the end of an arm. Most humans have two hands. Each hand usually has four fingers and a thumb. On the inside of the hand is the palm. The five bones inside this part of the hand are called metacarpals.</font>
</p><br></li>

<li><p style="color:DeepPink;">
<font size=5>The <b>Abdomen</b> (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity.</font>
</p><br>
</li>

<li><p style="color:DeepSkyBlue;">	
<font size=5>The human <b>Leg</b>, in the general meaning, is the entire lower limb of the human body, including the foot, thigh and even the hip or gluteal region. However, the definition in human anatomy refers only to the section of the lower limb extending from the knee to the ankle, also known as the <u>Crus</u>.</font>
</p><br>
</li>

<li>
<p style="color:Crimson;">
<font size=5>The <b>Foot</b> (plural feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates. It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion.</font>
