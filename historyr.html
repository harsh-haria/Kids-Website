<p style="color:Tomato;"><font size=5>As you can see we have plenty of sources for ancient Egyptian history (without sources it is not really possible to write about history). Now let us take a look at what we can learn from these sources.The history of ancient Egypt lasted until the country became a Roman province in the 1st century B.C.Egypt was ruled before then by thirty dynasties, or families, of kings and queens, often called the pharaohs.  This is known as Egypt’s dynastic period.<br>

<font size=5>World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although conflicts reflecting the ideological clash between what would become the Allied and Axis blocs began earlier. The vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—eventually formed two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most global war in history; it directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of total war, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.Videos related to World War II are down below:</font></p>
